# given a character set and center letter, output all the possible solutions by examing the dictionary file corresponding to center character
# this is probably not the most efficient approach; since we now allow repetitive letters (but they have to all come from the grid),
# we'll have to also consider the number of occurences of each letter in an entry. The most straightforward solution is to use the list
# of grid chars and remove letters from it as we scan each entry letter by letter in dictionary; we skip that entry once a remove fails; 
# otherwise we accept it as a solution

        # here I make a deep copy of the input chars array and remove elements from it everytime; not very efficient
        # instead, use an integer array of size 26, each element storing the count of that letter (e.g. charRay[0]=3 means 'a' appears 3 times in
        # chars, charRay[2]=0 means no appearance of 'c'); then for char in every line, subtract 1 from the corresponding entry in charRay, which is
        # the same as pool.remove(ch).
